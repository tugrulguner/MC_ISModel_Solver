It finds the ground state energy and corresponding spin
states of a Ising spin model given by user through input_file.txt

Calculation can be run by:
python main.py input_file.txt (or path/input_file.txt)

There is a log file 'ising_model_running.log' which shows
successfully progressing steps and Errors during the calculation

Resulting ground state energy and corresponding spin states are
saved to output_'test_name'.txt file where 'test_name' is
provided by the user in input_file
